Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on sepal and petal dimensions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification is a classic supervised learning project that aims to build a model to classify iris flowers into species. We use the popular Iris Dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal Length<\br>
Sepal Width<\br>
Petal Length<\br>
Petal Width<\br>
